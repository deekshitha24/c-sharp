# C# Mini Project

This repository includes a number of C# programs that illustrate various ideas and features.

## Programs

01. **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root.

The arithmetic operations included are:
 * Addition
 * Subtraction 
 * Multiplication 
 * Division 
 * Exponential
 * Square root


02. **Armstrong Numbers**: Find Armstrong numbers in a given range.

Here, we are checking for the given input number is Armstrong or not.
 * Elimination of negative numbers.


03. **Substring of Strings**: Find all substrings of a given string.
 * Especially checking for not a number.

  
04. **Divide By Zero Exception**: Handle DivideByZeroException in C#.
 * Exceptions are handled using Console.WriteLine
   
05. **Pascal's Triangle**: Print Pascal's Triangle pattern.
   * Pascal triangle generated with the numerics.

   
06. **Floyd's Triangle**: Print Floyd's Triangle pattern.
 * Usage of functions and comments.
   
07. **Read and Copy a Text File**: Read and copy the contents of a text file.

   
08. **Implementation of Stack Operations**: Implement basic stack operations like push, pop, peek, and display.

   
09. **Complex Numbers**: Perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.

    
10. **Polymorphism Concepts**: Demonstrate polymorphism concepts using shapes.

    
11. **Abstract Class for Calculating the Perimeter**: Use abstract classes to calculate the perimeter of shapes.

    
12. **Interface for Resizable**: Implement an interface for resizing rectangles.

## How to Run

By choosing the appropriate program number when prompted, each program can be executed separately.
